            1-5: The <em>knapsack problem</em> is as follows: given a set of integers <em>S = {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>}</em>,
            and a target number <em>T</em>, find a subset of <em>S</em> that adds up exactly to <em>T</em>. For example, there exists
            a subset within <em>S = {1, 2, 5, 9, 10}</em> that adds up to <em>T = 22</em> but not <em>T = 23</em>.
            <br />
            Find counterexamples of each of the following algorithms for the knapsack problem. That is, give an <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>
            where the algorithm does not find a solution that leaves the knapsack completely full, even though a full-knapsack solution exists.
            <br />
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Put the elements of <em>S</em> in the knapsack in left to right order if they fit, that is, the first-fit algorithm.
                    <br />
                    S = [5, 2, 1, 7, 8, 3] and T = 18. First-fit algorithm results in knapsackArray = [5, 2, 1, 7], stopping after 7 due to 8 not fitting.
                    knapsackSum = 15, not 18, therefore it is not a perfect fit. A perfect fit does exist, adding in 3 to the knapsack.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Put the elements of <em>S</em> in the knapsack from smallest to largest, that is, the best-fit algorithm.
                    <br />
                    S = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12] and T = 22. Best-fit algorithm results in knapsackArray = [2, 4, 6, 8], stopping after 8 due to 10 not fitting.
                    knapsackSum = 20, not 22, therefore it is not a perfect fit. A perfect fit does exist, using 10 and 12. 
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Put the elements of <em>S</em> in the knapsack from largest to smallest.
                    <br />
                    S = [14, 10, 8, 5, 1] and T = 15. This algorithm results in knapsackArray = [14], stopped after 14 due to 10 not fitting.
                    knapsackSum = 14, not 15, therefore it is not a perfect fit. A perfect fit does exist, adding in 1 to the knapsack.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            1-6: The <em>set cover problem</em> is as follows: given a set <em>S</em> of subsets <em>S<sub>1</sub>, ..., S<sub>m</sub></em> of
            the universal set <em>U = {1, ..., n}</em>, find the smallest subset of subsets <em>T &SubsetEqual; S</em> such that <em>&cup;<sub>t<sub>i</sub>&isin;T</sub><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">t</span><sub>i</sub> = U</em>.
            For example, consider the subsets <em>S<sub>1</sub> = {1, 3, 5}, S<sub>2</sub> = {2, 4}, S<sub>3</sub> = {1, 4}, and S<sub>4</sub> = {2, 5}</em>.
            The set cover of <em>{1, ..., 5}</em> would then be <em>S<sub>1</sub></em> and <em>S<sub>2</sub></em>.
            <br />
            Find a counterexample for the following algorithm. Select the largest subset for the cover, and then delete all its elements from the
            universal set. Repeat by adding the subset containing the largest number of uncovered elements until all are covered.
